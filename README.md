# Project Rationale: Using Twitter Data to Inform Digital Strategy
Background
There are more than 12 million active monthly Twitter users in Kenya. Circa 11.5 million are above 18 years, meaning that can make purchasing decisions. Twitter affords access affords to a campaign in better understanding customers. Thus, Twitter is a highly effective social media tool to get public views and sentiments on any brand, issue, etc. The scripts included here search and retrieve recent tweets (in the last week) in bulk from Twitter API using specified keyword.

# Proposition
Specifically, through Twitter, the algorithm can:  
# 1. Assess public opinion on issues
Twitter offers a reasonable space for free speech, making it a great source of unfiltered public opinion on various issues; e.g., brand, regulation, etc. A brand’s role is to consider and integrate these issues into its strategy. Our algorithm collects and analyzes tweets in bulk (hundreds of thousands) and uncovers the most or least important issues (e.g., top 5, 10 or bottom 10, 20, etc.) in the context of a keyword such as ‘X crisis, ‘Y scandal,’ etc. in whatever location. This enables the brand to only focus on weighty matters, negating noise or issues with little importance to customers. 

# 2. Assess customer attitudes to influence messaging
The algorithm also helps assess customers’ attitudes on the brand’s views. Put simply, it establishes what customers want to hear, allowing a campaign to tailor-make its messaging appropriately. 

# 3. Micro-targeting or customer profiling:-
The algorithm spools micro-data that allows for a more targeted reach, depending on the campaign’s objectives. E.g., if we establish that customers in a particular location posit neutral sentiment on the campaign, more ads can be deployed in the said (specific) location, making them (voters) more informed about what the campaign offers, pushing them closer to the campaign. Further, we can tweak the ad messaging to ensure that it includes the most important issues according to voters in the targeted location. 

# 4. Intelligence gathering on competitors
Finally, most of the objectives outlined across 1-3 can target the campaign’s competitors by answering:- how are they (competitors) perceived by customers? Is there any emerging crisis/information about the other brand that can be exploited? What concerns do near-neutral (i.e., not entirely sold about competitor’s proposition) customers worried about? These and other questions consider the need to be one’s toes regarding what is happening around competitors for deconstruction or reinforcement purposes.
